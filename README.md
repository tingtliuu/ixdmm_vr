# Interactive Storytelling and Digital Movie Making (ixdmm) DAT485/DIT999 

Course given at the shared department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg, by the division of [Interaction Design and Software Engineering](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/organisation/idse/Pages/default.aspx).

*Course syllabus for ixdmm is found here [(GU)](https://kursplaner.gu.se/pdf/kurs/en/DIT999) / [Chalmers](https://student.portal.chalmers.se/sv/chalmersstudier/minkursinformation/Sidor/SokKurs.aspx?course_id=32962&parsergrp=3)

This course is included in the M.Sc. programs Game Design and Technology and Interaction Design and Technology, with a major subject in Computer Science and Engineering specializing in Interaction Design.

This github repository is hosting the final project for the course, to be presented at the 13th of January 2022.

The final project is an interactive VR experience built in Unity, with the purpose to showcase the storytelling capabilities with narratives strengthened by interaction and immersion in VR.

This VR experience, titled "The Gift and The Giver", is attempting to make the player live through the experiences of giving away parts of yourself - and to make the player be in the scenario of being "the giver". The design is abstracted as to give room for interpretation, and the symbolism and lessons learned are written as to *hopefully* make the player think about prioritizising other people before them.

The project members are the following;

Samir Aoun (gusaousa@student.gu.se) *Game Design and Technology*

Johnny Hamnesj√∂ Olausson (johola@student.chalmers.se) *Interaction Design and Technologies*

Tingting Liu (gustingtli@student.gu.se) *Game Design and Technology*
